You know my stage name is an online Quiz. The user is asked to guess which answer is correct from a choice of three answers. There are 11 Questions to go through. Once the user selects an answer by clicking the relevant button, the game gives the feedback as to whether it was correct or not (green if correct and red if incorrect) and it also displays the correct answer. There is a progress status underneath the answers as well how they are doing in terms of questions answered correct. At the end of the quiz the user is brought to an end of quiz screen to see their score and feedback. From this point they can choose to start the game again. 

Potential future features could be to have a random selection of questions coded in the background based on a level of difficulty at the users choice.
